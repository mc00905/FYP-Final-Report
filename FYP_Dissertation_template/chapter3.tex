\chapter{Requirements and Specifications}

\section{Introduction}
In this section I will explore the actual requirements that the project aims to meet. The functionality of the end products will be specified creating tangible goals that can be tested against.
\section{Requirement Gathering}
No formal requirements gathering will take place, instead requirements will be pulled out of my last three years creating and working with the micro-services and their APIs at Hindsight Software. Essentially I will draw on my employment as a case study, and look to solve the issues we have encountered during our work.
