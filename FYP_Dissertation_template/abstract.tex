\chapter*{Abstract}

A micro-service architecture is a modern software application architecture in which the application is broken down into a set of loosely coupled services. These services need to communicate with one another, and the usage of RESTful APIs are a typical solution.

The aim of this project was to create a framework that facilitated the rapid development of both a set of micro-services and the RESTful API platform for handling their communication whilst maintaining development and API best practices and stability.

The project resulted in a framework being built, that being a curated suite of tools and libraries designed to build these RESTful micro-services. The use of this framework was showcased by the development of an exemplar micro-service.

Alongside the framework, modifications were made to the OpenAPI Code Generator, allowing an API client to be fully generated on demand for a micro-service, allowing a consumer of the generated library, typically another micro-service, to integrate communication with the service effortlessly.
