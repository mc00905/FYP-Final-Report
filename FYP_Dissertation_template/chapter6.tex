\chapter{Testing and Evaluation}
\section{Introduction}
This section will detail my plans on how I will test my solutions, and how I will determine how they have measured up against the specifications defined for them.
\section{Unit Testing with Jest and Nock}
\subsection{Jest}
General framework reasoning - Tie in to code coverage with Istanbul NYC built in
- high coverage = well tested
\subsection{Nock}
Using the library for creating intercepting mock http requests - can show rate limiting handling works etc
\subsection{Testing the handcrafted client}
\subsubsection{Intercepting HTTP requests with Nock and testing the clients handling}
How do nock + jest tie together
testing each method - does it pull out the responses, handle errror and rate limiting
\section{End to end testing the auto-generated client with the micro-service}
\subsection{Calling Endpoints}
Actually press the buttons, use ts-node to call an index file with function calls. 
Does the generated code work - call endpoints correctly. Does typescript pick up the typings. Do the added features work
\section{Back to the Objectives}
Have they been fulfilled etc
Why, why not
